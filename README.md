# Introduction

This is a skeleton project structure which will help you start solving the problem right away.

## Tools available to you.
- Node.js

## Checking for correctness 

- You can click on the `Run IO` button from the interview application, which will run your solution against some preconfigured inputs and show you the output.

## Running the project

- To run, issue the command `node main.ts '<input 1>' '<input 2>'` where  **input** is a valid input given in the problem statement.
- For example: `node main.ts 'PLACE_ORDER 101 Apple 5' 'TOTAL_COST 101'`

Note: Each full command should be wrapped in single quotes.
